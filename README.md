      Data Understanding
You can download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market#Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv
You can understand the data by looking at the data dictionary provided @ https://rpubs.com/kunaljubce/mlb_housing_data
1.	Import the data set in Python.
2.	View the dataset
3.	See the structure and the summary of the dataset to understand the data.
4.	Find out the number of:
	     a.) Numeric attributes:
	     b.) Categorical attributes:
       
        Data Preparation : Data Cleaning
  
•	Duplicate values: Identify if the datasets have duplicate values or not and remove the duplicate values. 
	Find out the number of rows present in the dataset
•	Before removing duplicate values
•	After removing duplicate values
•	Variable type: Check if all the variables have the correct variable type, based on the data dictionary. If not, then change them.
		For how many attributes did you need to change the data type?
•	Missing value treatment: Check which variables have missing values and use appropriate treatments. 
		For each of the variables, find the number of missing values and provide the value that they have been imputed with.
    
    Outlier Treatment: 
    
Identify the varibales : Make a subset of the dataset with all the numeric variables. 
		Outliers : For each variable of this subset, carry out the outlier detection. Find out the percentile distribution of each variable and carry out capping and flooring for outlier values.  
 Data Preparation Feature Engineering:
	Feature Transformation:
		Identify variables that have non-linear trends.
		How many variables have non-linear trends?
		Transform them (as required)
    
    Standardization:
Name the variables to be standardised before using a distance-based algorithm
   
     Dummy encoding :
Identify the number of dummy variables to be created for the variable steel.
Submit the Python script with Outputs in a document
